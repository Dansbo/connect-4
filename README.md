I succeeded by getting the board loaded to the screen using old routines and macros from the project X-shots I had with my brother.

I have also loaded the pieces that I figure I will be using sprites to move around.

My first obstacle will be to make the sprites appear on the top of the screen and then I figure the user can use the arrow keys and the return bottom to move the piece and release it down the column.

As the game has 6 rows by 7 columns I figure that in order to fill all the spaces there should be 42 game pieces in total an thus 21 per player.

The only instance I can figure there would be a draw is if all spaces are filled up and no one has four pieces in a row.

After that I need to have some bytes set aside to store the information of where there are pieces so that the computer at a later time can figure out if anyone has won the game.

I am realizing that starting from scratch is a bit of a test for myself. I can only blame myself as I have put this off for way to long.

My brother has been kind enough to help me. I cannot comprehend how frustrating this must be for him, as he also helped me a lot in the beginning. Almost a year ago. Lesson learned! I need to keep on programming to keep my knowledge up.

I have created the "board" for the game in piskel as well as the binaries for the player pieces.

I am thinking that I will keep this game rather simple and develop the AI in the same fashion as I did for tictactoe. And I'm thinking that maybe this game would benefit from mouse control as well.

Maybe I will start out just programming that the user can pick a "column" using the number keys. But I think it would be cool to also being able to use the mouse to point and click. But let's see how far I'll get with this.

At the moment it seems that I have been able to conjure up a way to load the board into the VERA videoram but somehow I missed how to enable the picture that I have just loaded. So I will need to go back to the documentation. (Maybe I should stop cheating by using my brothers inc file and code the stuff myself)

Anyways this is how far I got today.

This will be a project to try and revitalize my enthusiasm with assembly programming for the Commander X16.

I thought to myself that I had already created tictactoe for the platform.

I am thinking this project should be rather easy to accomplish.

This readme file will be updated as I go along and I will try to document the process
